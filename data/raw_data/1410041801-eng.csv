Footnotes:
1,"Indigenous group refers to whether the person is First Nations (North American Indian), Métis and/or Inuk (Inuit). A person may be included in more than one of these three specific groups. In the table, "Indigenous population" includes those who identified as First Nations, Métis, Inuit or with more than one Indigenous group. "First Nations people living off reserve" includes those who identified as First Nations only and "Métis" includes those who identified as Métis only. Data on persons reporting Inuit or multiple identities are included in the "Indigenous population" total but are not shown separately because of small sample sizes. Excluded from the survey’s coverage are persons living on reserves and other Indigenous settlements in the provinces, as well as those living in the territories."
2,"Excluding the territories."
3,"Beginning January 1997, information is collected on the usual wages or salary of employees at their main job. Respondents are asked to report their wage/salary before taxes and other deductions, and include tips, commissions and bonuses. Weekly and hourly wages/salaries are calculated in conjunction with usual paid work hours per week."
