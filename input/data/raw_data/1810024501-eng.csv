Footnotes:
1,"Average price estimates for these products are derived using transaction data from Canadian grocery retailers. The composition of a given product category may change over time due to evolving consumer purchasing patterns and product availability. Therefore, users should exercise caution when comparing average prices over time as average prices may not be fully comparable from one month to another and should not be used as a representative measure of pure price change through time. Note: Data are subject to revision."

3,"With the release of data for the January 2024 reference month, this table has been updated to incorporate data from additional grocery retailers, increasing the sample of price data used in the calculation of monthly average prices. This enhancement expands the coverage and improves the quality of the data, while ensuring the representativeness of prices paid by Canadian consumers. Users should continue to exercise caution when comparing average prices over time and when interpreting the 1-month change for January 2024 and the 12-month change for the next 12 months. "
4,"Specific size - In most cases, a specific size or quantity can be easily identified as the measure of best fit for a particular product. For some products, a specific size or quantity is the most commonly purchased by a considerable amount (for example, 1 dozen eggs). Other products have multiple high-sale sizes over a large range (for example, milk). In this case we calculate separate average prices for each size (1 litre, 2 litres and 4 litres) in order to provide a fuller picture. Other products such as fresh produce and meats are often sold by weight, and provided as a price per kilogram. In these cases, one kilogram is applied as the specific size. These products are then standardized to ensure that the price per one kilogram is included in the average price calculation. The specific size alone provides sufficient coverage to produce a robust measure."
